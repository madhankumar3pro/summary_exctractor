THE BOY WHO LIVED  
 
Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say  
that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last  
people you'd expect to be involv ed in anything strange or mysterious,  
because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.  
 
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made  
drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did  
have a very large mustac he. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had  
nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she  
spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the  
neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their  
opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.  
 
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and  
their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't  
think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.  
Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;  
in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her  
sister and her good -for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was  
possible to be. The Dursleys shuddere d to think what the neighbors would  
say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the  
Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy  
was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want  
Dudley mixing with a child like that.  
 
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story  
starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that  
strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the  
country . Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for"," The text delimited by triple backquotes tells the story of a normal family with one strange secret.

1,"As he had expected, Mrs. Durs ley looked shocked and angry. After all,  
they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.  
 
""No,"" she said sharply. ""Why?""  
 
""Funny stuff on the news,"" Mr. Dursley mumbled. ""Owls... shooting  
stars... and there were a lot of funny -looking people in tow n today...""  
 
""So?"" snapped Mrs. Dursley.  
 
""Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you  
know... her crowd.""  
 
Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered  
whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name ""Potter."" He decided he  
didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, ""Their son -- 
he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?""  
 
""I suppose so,"" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.  
 
""What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?""  
 
""Harry. Nasty, commo n name, if you ask me.""  
 
""Oh, yes,"" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ""Yes, I quite  
agree.""  
 
He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.  
While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the 
bedroom  
window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there.  
It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for  
something.

whatever ""everyone"" was saying, she was not going to believe it until  
Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing  
another lemon drop and did not answer.  
 
""What they're saying,"" she press ed on, ""is that last night Voldemort  
turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is  
that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead. ""  
 
Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.  
 
""Lily and James...  I can't believe it... I didn't want to believe it...  
Oh, Albus...""  
 
Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. ""I know... I  
know..."" he said heavily.  
 
Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. ""That's not all.

couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how,

done... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy?

name of heaven did Ha rry survive?""  
 
""We can only guess,"" said Dumbledore. ""We may never know.""

3,"A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and  
tidy under the inky sky, the very last place yo u would expect  
astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his  
blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside  
him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was  
famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs.  
Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk  
bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and  
pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn't know that at this very  
moment, people  meeting in secret all over the country were holding up  
their glasses and saying in hushed voices: ""To Harry Potter -- the boy  
who lived!""  
 
 
CHAPTER TWO  
 
THE VANISHING GLASS  
 
Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find  
their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at  
all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass  
number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living  
room, which was almost exactly the same as it h ad been on the night when  
Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the  
photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.  
Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a  
large pink beac h ball wearing different -colored bonnets -- but Dudley  
Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large  
blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a  
computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed b y his mother.  
The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.  
 
Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for  
long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made", Return your response in short and crisp summary.,"A seemingly ordinary boy, Harry Potter, sleeps unknowingly in a mundane neighborhood, oblivious to his eventual discovery of being a wizard and the pivotal role he will play in a world filled with magic, fame, and the echoes of a prophecy."
4,"""What about what's -her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?""  
 
""On vacation in Majorca,"" snapped Aunt Petunia.  
 
""You could just leave me here,"" Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to  
watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a 
go 
on Dudley's computer).  
 
Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon.  
 
""And come back and find the house in  ruins?"" she snarled.  
 
""I won't blow up the house,"" said Harry, but they weren't listening.  
 
""I suppose we could take him to the zoo,"" said Aunt Petunia slowly, ""...  
and leave him in the car....""  
 
""That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone....""  
 
Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had  
been years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up  
his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.  
 
""Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won' t let him spoil your special  
day!"" she cried, flinging her arms around him.  
 
""I... don't... want... him... t -t-to come!"" Dudley yelled between huge,  
pretend sobs. ""He always sp - spoils everything!"" He shot Harry a nasty  
grin through the gap in his mot her's arms.  
 
Just then, the doorbell rang -- ""Oh, good Lord, they're here!"" said Aunt  
Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers  
Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face"," Vacation in Majorca is disrupted when Dudley has to accompany his  
              friend Harry, causing a rift in their friendship; Harry, 
              however, finds an ally in Piers and enjoys the holiday despite  
              the tensions.","Harry's summer takes a turn for the worse as Aunt Petunia reluctantly plans a family outing to the zoo to avoid leaving him alone at home, while Dudley and his friend Piers create chaos."
5,"The snake nodded vigorously.  
 
""Where do you come from, anyway?"" Harry asked.  
 
The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign  next to the glass. Harry  
peered at it.  
 
Boa Constrictor, Brazil.  
 
""Was it nice there?""  
 
The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on:  
This specimen was bred in the zoo. ""Oh, I see -- so you've never been to  
Brazil?""  
 
As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of  
them jump.  
 
""DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! 
YOU WON'T BELIEVE  
WHAT IT'S DOING!""  
 
Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.  
 
""Out of the way, you ,"" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by  
surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened  
so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were  
leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had le apt back with  
howls of horror.  
 
Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank  
had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering  
out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and  
started  running for the exits.","- A large snake with a distinctive ""nod"" was seen in a zoo, and people were scared.
           - The snake was originally bred in Brazil and its tail wagged at a sign near it.
           - The snake's habitat was a zoo, and it was later discovered that it had been relocated to a different location.
           -","A snake from Brazil's zoo communicates with Harry through a glass enclosure, but chaos ensues when Dudley and his friend Piers provoke the snake, causing it to escape and panic visitors in the reptile house."
6,"Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of 
the 
smell from Harry's new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as  
usual and Dudley ban ged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere,  
on the table.  
 
They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the  
doormat.  
 
""Get the mail, Dudley,"" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.  
 
""Make Harry get it.""  
 
""Get the mail, Harry.""  
 
""Make Dudley get it.""  
 
""Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.""  
 
Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things  
lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who 
was 
vacationing on the Isle of  Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a  
bill, and -- a letter for Harry.  
 
Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant  
elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who  
would? He had no friends, no othe r relatives -- he didn't belong to the  
library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet  
here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:  
 
Mr. H. Potter  
 
The Cupboard under the Stairs"," Harry Potter receives a letter which makes him excited, and  
            makes him think of a letter sent to him from his uncle and  
            aunt, which prompts him to go outside and pick up more  
            mail.","Dudley and Uncle Vernon dismissively order Harry to fetch the mail, but Harry receives a surprising letter addressed to him, sparking curiosity and a sense of belonging in his lonely life."
7,"Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in  
shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting st ick, been  
sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the  
greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was  
thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the  
letter in the hall. Uncle Verno n and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each  
other darkly.  
 
When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice  
to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with  
his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then h e shouted, ""There's  
another one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --'"" 
 
With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the  
hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the  
ground to get t he letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact  
that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After 
a 
minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the  
Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping f or breath, with  
Harry's letter clutched in his hand.  
 
""Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom,"" he wheezed at Harry.  
""Dudley -- go -- just go.""  
 
Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had 
moved out  
of his cupboard and they s eemed to know he hadn't received his first  
letter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure  
they didn't fail. He had a plan.  
 
The repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry  
turned it off quickly and dresse d silently. He mustn't wake the  
Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights."," The Dursleys have changed after moving to a new house, and Harry is determined to get his room back.

8,"want to stay somewhere with a television. ""  
 
Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you  
could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of  
television -- then tomor row, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of  
course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys  
had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.  
Still, you weren't eleven every day.  
 
Uncle Vernon was back and  he was smiling. He was also carrying a long,  
thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd  
bought.  
 
""Found the perfect place!"" he said. ""Come on! Everyone out!""  
 
It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at w hat 
looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was  
the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was  
certain, there was no television in there.  
 
""Storm forecast for tonight!"" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clappin g his  
hands together. ""And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his  
boat!""  
 
A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather  
wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron -gray water below  
them.  
 
""I've already got us so me rations,"" said Uncle Vernon, ""so all aboard!""  
 
It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their  
necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like  
hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sli ding,  
led the way to the broken -down house.","- The response is that Harry wants to stay somewhere with a television. The text delimited by triple backquotes is ""Return your response in short and crisp meaningful summary."" The response indicates that Harry will be staying at the house with an old, cold, and miserable shack, where the TV will be absent.","Harry, anticipating his eleventh birthday, is taken by Uncle Vernon to a desolate shack on a rock, devoid of television, in the midst of an approaching storm, for an uncertain celebration."
9,"the warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath.  
 
The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and  
began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a  
copper kettle,  a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several  
chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from  
before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and  
smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was  
working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt  
sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said  
sharply, ""Don't touch anything he gives you, Dudley.""  
 
The giant chuckled darkly.  
 
""Yet great puddin'  of a son don' need fattenin' anymore, Dursley, don'  
worry.""  
 
He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted  
anything so wonderful, but he still couldn't take his eyes off the  
giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain a nything, he said,  
""I'm sorry, but I still don't really know who you are.""  
 
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his  
hand.  
 
""Call me Hagrid,"" he said, ""everyone does. An' like I told yeh, I'm  
Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' course.  
 
""Er -- no,"" said Harry.  
 
Hagrid looked shocked.  
 
""Sorry,"" Harry said quickly.

""We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish,"" said  
Uncle Vernon, ""swore we'd stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!""  
 
""You knew?"" said Harry. ""You knew I'm a -- a wizard?""  
 
""Knew!"" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. ""Knew! Of course we kn ew! 
How  
could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a  
letter just like that and disappeared off to that -that school -and came

into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak!  
But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that,

scuttled back to their corne r. ""How could a car crash kill Lily an'

11,"""Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or  
angry?""  
 
Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it... every odd  
thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had  
happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry... chased by Dudley's  
gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going  
to school wit h that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow  
back... and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn't he got his  
revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn't he set a boa  
constrictor on him?

beaming at him.

right famous at Hogwarts.""  
 
But Uncle Vernon wasn't going to give in without a fight.

""Got everythin'? Come on, then.""  
 
Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and  
the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was  
still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.  
 
""How did you get here?"" Harry asked, looking around for another boat.  
""Flew,"" said Hagrid . 
 
""Flew?""  
 
""Yeah -- but we'll go back in this. Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've

They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to  
imagine him flying.  
 
""Seems a shame ter row, though,"" said Hagrid, giving Harry  another of  
his sideways looks. ""If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, would  
yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?""  
 
""Of course not,"" said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out  
the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and  
they sped off toward land.

spoke. ""They say there's dragons guardin' the highsecurity vaults. And"," Harry's at Hagrid's, and they're flying to a Gringotts bank vault, to get money for Hogwarts because they're short.

13,"""Can we buy all this in London?"" Harry wondered aloud.  
 
""If yeh know where to go,"" said Hagrid.  
 
Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know  
where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an  
ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and  
complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.  
 
""I don't know how the Muggles manage without magic,"" he said as they  
climbed a br oken -down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined  
with shops.  
 
Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do  
was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores,  
hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but no where that looked as if it  
could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of  
ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles  
beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and  
broomsticks? Might  this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had  
cooked up? If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of  
humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything  
Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't hel p 
trusting him.  
 
""This is it,"" said Hagrid, coming to a halt, ""the Leaky Cauldron. It's a  
famous place.""  
 
It was a tiny, grubby -looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out,  
Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn't  
glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the  
record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at  
all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and  
Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered  
him inside."," Hagrid and Harry visit London, where Hagrid tells Harry the Leaky Cauldron exists.

little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a  
uniform of scarlet and gold, was - 
 
""Yeah, that's a goblin,"" said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the w hite 
stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry.  
He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very  
long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were  
facing a second pair of doors, sil ver this time, with words engraved  
upon them:  
 
Enter, stranger, but take heed  
 
Of what awaits the sin of greed,

Of finding more than treasure there.  
 
""Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it,"" said Hagrid.  
 
A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a  
vast marble hall. About  a hundred more goblins were sitting on high  
stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing  
coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses.  
There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more

""Hello,"" said the boy, ""Hogwarts, too?""  
 
""Yes,"" said Harry.  
 
""My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street  
looking at wands,"" said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. ""Th en 
I'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don't see why  
first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting  
me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow.""  
 
Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.  
 
""Have you got your own broom?"" the boy went on.  
 
""No,"" said Harry.  
 
""Play Quidditch at all?""  
 
""No,"" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.  
 
""I do -- Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my  
house, and I must say, I agree. Know wha t house you'll be in yet?""  
 
""No,"" said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.

I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being in  
Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, w ouldn't you?"" ""Mmm,"" said Harry, wishing  
he could say something a bit more interesting.  
 
""I say, look at that man!"" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the  
front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing  
at two large ice crea ms to show he couldn't come in."," Harry Potter is visited by a boy who seems to have just

16,"The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door  
read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay  
on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.  
 
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped  
inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair  
that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had  
entered a very strict library; he swallowed  a lot of new questions that  
had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow  
boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of  
his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle  
with some  secret magic.  
 
""Good afternoon,"" said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have  
jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly  
off the spindly chair.  
 
An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like  
moons through the gloom of the shop.  
 
""Hello,"" said Harry awkwardly.  
 
""Ah yes,"" said the man. ""Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon.  
Harry Potter."" It wasn't a question. ""You have your mother's eyes. It  
seems only yesterday she was in here he rself, buying her first wand. Ten  
and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm  
work.""  
 
Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink.

silvery eyes were a bit creepy.

hard. Yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard. But yeh'll have a  
great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do, 'smatter of fact.""  
 
Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the  
Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.  
 
""Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, "" he said. ""First o' September -- King's Cross  
-- it's all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a  
letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me.... See yeh soon,  
Harry.""  
 
The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until  
he was out of sight; he rose in his s eat and pressed his nose against  
the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.  
 
 
CHAPTER SIX  
 
THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE -QUARTERS  
 
Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun. True, Dudley was now so  
scared of Harry he wouldn't  stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia  
and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do  
anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all.  
Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry  
in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did  
become a bit depressing after a while.  
 
Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to  
call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His sc hool 
books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the  
night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It  
was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because"," Harry's last month with the Dursleys is not a happy one, with  
                    minimal interaction and constant fear from Dudley. His new  
                    pet owl, Hedwig, is a comforting presence and distraction from  
                    his home life. Harry uses the time to read and prepare for  
                    Hogwarts.","Harry receives encouragement from Hagrid as he prepares to return to Hogwarts, and despite a challenging last month with the Dursleys, he eagerly anticipates the journey to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters."
18,"""Only joking, I am Fred,"" said the boy, and off he went. His twin called  
after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later,  
he had gone -- but how had he done it?  
 
Now the third brother was walking br iskly toward the barrier he was  
almost there -- and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere.  
 
There was nothing else for it.  
 
""Excuse me,"" Harry said to the plump woman.  
 
""Hello, dear,"" she said. ""First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too.""  
 
She poi nted at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and  
gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.  
 
""Yes,"" said Harry. ""The thing is -- the thing is, I don't know how to  
--"" 
 
""How to get onto the platform?"" she said kindl y, and Harry nodded.  
 
""Not to worry,"" she said. ""All you have to do is walk straight at the  
barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared  
you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a  
run if you're nerv ous. Go on, go now before Ron.""  
 
""Er -- okay,"" said Harry.  
 
He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very  
solid.  
 
He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to  
platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more qu ickly. He was going to 
smash  
right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble -- leaning forward"," Returning a response to the boy's `""I am Fred""` comment, his third brother went missing.

19,"""Who?""  
 
""Harry Potter!""  
 
Harry heard the little gir l's voice.  
 
""Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please....""  
 
""You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you  
goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?""  
 
""Asked him. Saw his scar. It's really ther e - like lightning.""  
 
""Poor dear - no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite  
when he asked how to get onto the platform.""  
 
""Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You -Know -Who looks  
like?""  
 
Their mother suddenly became very  stern.  
 
""I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don't you dare. As though he needs  
reminding of that on his first day at school.""  
 
""All right, keep your hair on.""  
 
A whistle sounded.  
 
""Hurry up!"" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto t he 
train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good -bye, and  
their younger sister began to cry.  
 
""Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls."""," Harry Potter, who was already on a train, heard a little girl calling 
            him. He asked who she was and the girl's mother told him the girl  
            had no business asking him. Harry was forbidden from asking the girl's 
            name. Nonetheless, Harry's mother allowed him to ask and confirmed 
            ""All right,","Ginny eagerly wants to see Harry Potter on the train to Hogwarts, but her mother warns against staring at him due to his famous scar. The three Weasley brothers board the train, leaving their teary-eyed sister behind."

Licorice  
Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen i n his  
life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid  
the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.  
 
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped  
it onto an empty seat.  
 
""Hungry, are you?""  
 
""Starving,"" said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.  
 
Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four  
sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, ""She always  
forgets I don't like corned beef.""  
 
""Swa p you for one of these,"" said Harry, holding up a pasty. ""Go on --"" 
 
""You don't want this, it's all dry,"" said Ron. ""She hasn't got much  
time,"" he added quickly, ""you know, with five of us.""  
 
""Go on, have a pasty,"" said Harry, who had never had anythi ng to share  
before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling,  
sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties,  
cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).  
 
""What are these?"" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pa ck of Chocolate 
Frogs.  
""They're not really frogs, are they?"" He was starting to feel that  
nothing would surprise him.  
 
""No,"" said Ron. ""But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa.""  
 
""What?"""," Harry finds a strange, unfamiliar woman on a platform, who offers a range of sweets and treats but doesn't know what a Sickle is. Ron has a more mundane response to Harry's request for food, but he also enjoys Harry's company and the chance to share stories.

""I'm Ron Weasley,"" Ron muttered.  
 
""Harry Potter,"" said Harry.  
 
""Are yo u really?"" said Hermione. ""I know all about you, of course -- I 
got a few extra books. for background reading, and you're in Modern  
Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great  
Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.  
 
""Am I?"" sa id Harry, feeling dazed.  
 
""Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it  
was me,"" said Hermione. ""Do either of you know what house you'll be in?  
I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far  
the best;  I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw  
wouldn't be too bad.... Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's  
toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there  
soon.""  
 
And she left, taking the toadless boy with h er. 
 
""Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it,"" said Ron. He threw his  
wand back into his trunk. ""Stupid spell -- George gave it to me, bet he  
knew it was a dud.""  
 
""What house are your brothers in?"" asked Harry.  
 
""Gryffindor,"" said Ron. Gloom  seemed to be settling on him again. ""Mom  
and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I  
don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in  
Slytherin.""  
 
""That's the house Vol -, I mean, You -Know -Who was in?"""," Hermione had been asking around, hoping to get in Gryffindor, as it was the most prestigious house.

He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on thei r long black robes.  
Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath  
them.  
 
A voice echoed through the train: ""We will be reaching Hogwarts in five  
minutes' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken  
to the sc hool separately.""  
 
Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under  
his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and  
joined the crowd thronging the corridor.  
 
The train slowed right down and finally stopp ed. People pushed their way  
toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in  
the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the  
students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: ""Firs' years! Firs' years  
over here! All r ight there, Harry?""  
 
Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.  
 
""C'mon, follow me -- any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs'  
years follow me!""  
 
Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a  
steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry  
thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the  
boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.  
 
""Ye' all get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec,"" Hagrid called over  
his shoulder, ""jus' round this bend here.""  
 
There was a loud ""Oooooh!"""," Hagrid's voice echoed through the train as they reach a path leading to Hogwarts. Students shuffling with nerves and excitement follow Hagrid, who leads them to the school, where they take their luggage off the train and hurry through the night, eager to reach Hogwarts and start their journey.","Harry and Ron, aboard the Hogwarts Express, prepare for arrival as the train slows down. Upon reaching Hogwarts, they join the first-years and follow Hagrid to the castle in the dark night."
23,"Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away  
through the opposite wall.  
 
""Now, form a line,"" Professor McGonagall told the first years, ""and  
follow me.""  
 
Feeling oddly as t hough his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line  
behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out  
of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors  
into the Great Hall.  
 
Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was  
lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair  
over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.  
These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the  
top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.  
Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a  
halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.  
The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the  
flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the  
ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry  
looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He  
heard  
 
Hermione whisper, ""Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read  
about it in Hogwarts, A History.""  
 
It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the  
Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens.  
 
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed  
a four -legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she  
put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and  
extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house."," Return your response in short and crisp summary.

The hat is a symbol of","Professor McGonagall leads the first-year students into the magical and dazzling Great Hall at Hogwarts, where they are greeted by floating candles, golden plates, and a bewitched ceiling resembling the night sky.

24,"he fell over on  his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide  
with Neville. When it finally shouted, ""GRYFFINDOR,"" Neville ran off  
still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it  
to ""MacDougal, Morag.""  
 
Malfoy swaggered forward whe n his name was called and got his wish at  
once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, 
""SLYTHERIN!""  
 
Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with  
himself.  
 
There weren't many people left now. ""Moon"" ""Nott"" ""Pa rkinson"" then a  
pair of twin girls, ""Patil"" and ""Patil"" then ""Perks, Sally -Anne"" and  
then, at last -- ""Potter, Harry!""  
 
As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little  
hissing fires all over the hall.  
 
""Potter, did she say?""  
 
The Harry Potter?""  
 
The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the  
hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he  
was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.  
 
Hmm,"" said a small voice in his ear. ""Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty  
of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, A my goodness,  
yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting....  
So where shall I put you?""  
 
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and tho ught, Not Slytherin, not  
Slytherin."," Neville received his house, Gryffindor, as well as a hat,
